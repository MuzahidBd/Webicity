For external contributors:

It is not advised that you work in this folder unless you know what you are doing.

Most code in this folder is either based off of a spec, support code for other code based on the spec,
or temporary non-spec implementations that will be replaced by spec-complant code at a later time.

Do not attempt to shorten or clean up long, complex, or hard-to-read methods, unless you are absolutely certain that they do not directly correlate directly the spec.
Most code in this directory (excluding token or helper classes) is a direct port of the spec to code, and any attempt to clean it up may make it less spec-compliant,
or harder to reference when compared side-by-side with the spec.
